This is the repo for (the now defunct) Emoji Salad.

Emoji Salad was an SMS-based game of Emoji Pictionary developed by SIBlings in 2015. It made enemies out of friends and friends out of enemies.

A game would go something like this:

```
BOT (to all)
👾 You'll start us off, 🦁Ari! Your phrase is: THE LEGEND OF ZELDA

Reply using emojis only. Your goal is to get the other players to guess your phrase. Text OPTIONS if you get stuck, and PASS if you give up. (PASS will cost you 1 point).

//////////

ARI
🎮👸⚔️🛡

//////////

BOT (only to Ari)
👾 Gosh, those are great! Let's get started.

BOT (to group)
🦁Ari's clue: 🎮👸⚔️🛡

Text OPTIONS if you get stuck, and don't forget to ask for a CLUE if you get stuck!

//////////

KEVIN
Legend of Zelda

//////////

BOT (to all)
👾 YAY ⚾️ Kevin got it RIGHT! The phrase was THE LEGEND OF ZELDA

👾 It's your turn, ⚾️ Kevin...

```

## Why can't I play this game?

Emoji Salad had a good run, it got us through some tough times, but part of growing up is knowing when to pull the plug.

If you'd like us to set you up a private game, send one of us an email and we'll try and set you up. You might have to buy us a beer for your troubles though :)
